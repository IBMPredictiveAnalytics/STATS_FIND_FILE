STATS FIND FILE Extension Command
=================================

Define a file handle for the folder where the first instance
of the specified file or wildcard is found.

STATS FIND FILE 
FILENAME = "*file*"^&#42;  
FILEHANDLE = *handle*^&#42;  
FOLDERLIST = "*semicolon-separated list of folders*"  
ENVVARIABLE = "*semi-colon-separated environment variable names*"  
SEARCHSUBFOLDERS = YES or NO^&#42;&#42;

/OPTIONS  
PRINTSEARCH = YES or NO^&#42;&#42;  
PRINTHANDLE = YES^&#42;&#42; or NO

/HELP

^&#42; Required  
^&#42;&#42; Default

/HELP displays this help and does nothing else.

Example:
```
STATS FIND FILE FILENAME="employee data.*" FILEHANDLE=employee
FOLDERLIST="c:/spss/samples/english;c:/data".
```

**FILENAME** specifies the file or file wildcard to locate.

**FILEHANDLE** specifies the name of the handle to be assigned.

Specify either or both of **FOLDERLIST** and **ENVVARIABLE**.  FOLDERLIST
is a string in quotes listing the folder or folders to search.  Separate
folder specifications with a semi-colon.

**ENVVARIABLE** is a string in quotes listing one or more environment variables
that list a folder or folders to search.  Again, specifications are separated by
a semicolon.  By using this feature, you can avoid the need to specify
specific locations for files, leaving that to your system or user environment.

If both FOLDERLIST and ENVVARIABLE are specified, the FOLDERLIST
is searched first.

By default, only the listed locations are searched.  Specify 
**SEARCHSUBFOLDERS**=YES to search all the subfolders of folders listed.

OPTIONS
-------
By default, the generated handle is displayed.  Specify **PRINTHANDLE**=NO
to suppress this.

Specify **PRINTSEARCH**=YES to display a table listing all the locations
searched in the order they were searched.

If a listed folder or environment variable does not exist, it is ignored.

If the specified file is not found, an error is raised.
