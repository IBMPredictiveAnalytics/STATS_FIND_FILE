<h1>Define a File Handle Pointing to the Location of a Specified File</h1>
The command creates a file handle pointing to the location where a file
is found following a specified search strategy.  The strategy consists of a
list of locations to look in.  This can be a list of folders and/or
a list of environment variables whose values are lists of folders.  The first
location containing the file is the one used in defining the handle.
<p>
By using this command, you can create jobs that do not have to know exactly where their
input data and syntax files reside.
<p>The file specification can be a complete name or it can be a 
wildcard expression.  Path information is not specified.
<p><span class="runinhead">File or Wildcard to Find.</span> 
Specify a file name or wildcard expression to search for. An example of a wildcard
expression is.
<br>
x*.sav
<br>
which means a file whose name starts with x and has extension sav.</p>
<p class="bullet">&bull; If the file system is case sensitive, the file search
will also be case sensitive.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Folders to Search</span> Enter the path to a folder or a list
of paths separated by a semicolon.  For example,
<br>
c:\currentproject;c:\data
<br>
<p><span class="runinhead">Environment Variables to Search</span> Enter the name
of an environment variable or a list of environment variables separated by a semicolon.
The values of the environment variables should be lists of folders as above or in a 
typical PATH environment variable.  For example, if MYDATA is defined as
<br>
c:\projectdata;c:\standarddata
<br>
then specifying MYDATA would be equivalent to having specified these folders in
the first control.
<p>The method for creating environment variables differs according to the
operating system.  On Windows, you can go to 
Control Panel>System>Advanced>Environment Variables
to define them.
<p>
<p class="bullet">&bull; You must specify at least one of these two controls.  If both are specified,
the folder lists are searched first.
<p class="bullet">&bull; If a specified location or environment variable does not
exist, it is ignored.
<p><span class="runinhead">Search subfolders.</span> 
Check this box to search the subfolders of the specified locations
as well as the locations themselves.  All the subfolders of a location are
searched before proceeding to the next location.

<p><span class="runinhead">File Handle to Create.</span> Enter the name
for the handle to create.  If the file is not found in any of the specified locations,
an error is raised, and the handle is not defined.
<p class="bullet">&bull; The rules for handle names are the same as for variables.
<p class="bullet">&bull; If the file handle had been defined previously, that
definition remains in case of an error in this command.
<p><span class="runinhead">Output Options.</span> 
Check the boxes to determine the output in the Viewer.  The first checkbox
causes a small table to be produced that shows the definition.  (SHOW HANDLES
can be used to display all the handle definitions.)  Check the second box
to display a list of the locations that were searched in the order that they
were searched.

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>
This dialog generates syntax for the STATS FIND FILE extension command. To display help for this command,
run the following syntax:
</p>
<p class="codeblock">STATS FIND FILE /HELP.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>
This command requires the Python Programmability Plug-in,
You can download
it from SPSS Developer Central (www.spss.com/devcentral).
