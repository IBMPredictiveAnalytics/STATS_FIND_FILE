# STATS FIND FILE
## Create file handle in location of a searched for file
 By using this command, you can create jobs that do not have to know exactly where their input data and syntax files reside.  The command creates a file handle pointing to the location where a file is found following a specified search strategy.  The strategy consists of a list of locations to look in.
